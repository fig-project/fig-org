The FiG philosophy is: anything that can be named is alive. The word FiG is the generic term for such a living creature, [coined in 1998](./figstory.md). So, anything that can be named is a FiG. You are a FiG, objects are FiGs, ideas are FiGs, the FiG philosophy is a FiG, the universe is a FiG.

This philosophy matters because it takes human beings out of the centre of the universe. We are FiGs like all the rest, but rather than reducing humans to the level of spiritless machines, the FiG philosophy raises everything to the level of conscious, spiritual beings in a web of communication.

The [FiG Project](./project.md) promotes the word FiG as an inclusive term for people to use to communicate their belief in this cooperative existence, and encourages people to act on this belief.
