The purpose of the FiG Project is to spread the [FiG philosophy](./philosophy.md). There are no entrance requirements or creed to follow in order to be a member of the FiG Project, because the philosophy asserts that everyone and everything is a FiG, even people who claim not to be one.

If you want to join the FiG Project, simply use the word FiG to describe who you are, and if you wish, direct people to [`https://fig.org/`](https://fig.org/) if they ask to learn more about the FiG Project.

For those of you who are interested in advertising your support of the FiG Project, contact [<project@fig.org>](mailto:project@fig.org) to arrange for your very own `yourname@fig.org` e-mail alias or `yourname.fig.org` domain name alias.
